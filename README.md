# Fundle
*Created on ETHKL2024*

## Project Description

**Problem:** Many budding entrepreneurs and small businesses struggle to raise capital to bring their ideas to life. Current fundraising models, like crowdfunding platforms, often come with high fees and limited transparency. Fundle addresses this issue by enabling decentralized and transparent fundraising on the blockchain.

**Solution:** Fundle is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows project creators to launch fundraising campaigns on Scroll Sepolia. Supporters can contribute ETH directly to the campaign smart contract, with all funds and contributions being tracked transparently on-chain. Creators can set milestones, and funds are only released when these milestones are met, ensuring project accountability. If the project fails to achieve its goals, the contributors are refunded automatically by the smart contract.

## Technical Implementation

### Scroll

The Fundle smart contract is deployed on Scroll. You can view the contract address and verification on the Scroll Sepolia explorer:
